🎓 Student Marks Calculator

A simple JavaScript mini project that calculates a student's total marks, average, highest and lowest score, and sorts all marks — using arrays, loops, and DOM manipulation.

🧠 Concepts Covered

This project helps you practice:

Arrays (reduce, sort, Math.max, Math.min)

DOM manipulation (querySelector, innerHTML)

Conditionals (if, some)

Input validation

Template literals

Basic CSS layout and styling

🖥️ Demo Preview
Example Output:
Student Marks: [78, 45, 89, 67, 92]

Total Marks: 371
Average: 74.20%
Highest Mark: 92
Lowest Mark: 45
Sorted Marks: [45, 67, 78, 89, 92]

⚙️ How It Works

Enter marks for four subjects (each between 0 and 100).

Click the Calculate button.

The app will display:

✅ Total Marks

✅ Average Percentage

✅ Highest & Lowest Marks

✅ Sorted List of Marks

If you enter any invalid value (like blank, negative, or above 100), it will show a warning message.
